# Daily-Fantasy-Basketball
Creating a winning daily fantasy sports lineup can be thought of as a selecting a winning coalition of representatives from a group of possible delegates. 
By modeling the problem of creating a winning lineup as a problem of finding decisive coalitions, the Banzhaf index can be used to evaluate the strength of individual fantasy players. 
This project explores the use of the Banzhaf index metric in relation to daily fantasy sports.
